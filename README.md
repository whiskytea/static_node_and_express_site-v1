# static_node_and_express_site-v1
 Unit 6 project - Static Node/Express Site

This is a portfolio site that showcases the first few units of homework assignments. I also included a connect four game from the Javascript Track, and the Flashcards
App used to teach us Express in the unit 6 module. The Flash cards app does not run in github pages, so I refactored it to run in this app.

Whisky Tea is the brand identity I'm considering running with, so I have custome made the logo myself. The error page image is hand drawn. 
I also added a banner on the right side of the site that clearly displays the site name. 

The custom font is Aquire, which I have purchased a commercial license for: https://sesohq.sellfy.store/p/ff7uie/
