          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p This is my elevator pitch. It is the elevator pitch to end all elevator pitches. Your mind is blown. Your mortal brain can scarcely process how well my prior experience maps to your open dev position.
          p The above was the stock content for this page. I enjoy it too much to replace it. Anyways, I am a well rounded developer, artist, problem-solver, persistent to a fault squirrel brain. I am a modular swiss army knife, and am willing to learn whatever I need to get the job done. I am just as liable to ping pong off 7 different tasks as I am to lose 7 hours to one.
          p If you think I would be a good fit for you team, I can be reached via email or via message in whatever relevant social media I feel like beating my brain against (links will be posted).
