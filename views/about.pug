          p Hi.
          p I am a well rounded developer, artist, problem-solver, persistent to a fault squirrel brain. I am a modular swiss army knife, and am willing to learn whatever I need to get the job done. I am just as liable to ping pong off 7 different tasks as I am to lose 7 hours to one.
          p If you think I would be a good fit for you team, I can be reached via email or via message in whatever relevant social media I feel like messing with these days (links will be posted).
